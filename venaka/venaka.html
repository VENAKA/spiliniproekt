                    Combat in Warframe is dynamic, fast-paced, and highly versatile,
                    blending both ranged and melee elements seamlessly. Hereâ€™s a
                    detailed overview of the combat system <br />
                    Primary Weapons: These include rifles, shotguns, bows, and other
                    two-handed weapons. They offer a variety of fire modes, from
                    automatic and semi-automatic to burst and charged shots. Secondary
                    Weapons: These are typically one-handed weapons like pistols,
                    throwing knives, and hand cannons. They serve as a backup to
                    primary weapons and are often faster to use. Sniper Rifles: These
                    long-range weapons are designed for precision shooting and can
                    deal significant damage, especially with headshots.Weapon Types:
                    Players can wield swords, axes, staves, whips, claws, and many
                    other types of melee weapons. Each type has unique animations and
                    attack patterns. Combos: Melee weapons have combo systems that
                    allow players to chain attacks for greater damage and effects.
                    Different stances can be equipped to alter the move set and unlock
                    new combos. Channeling: This feature allows players to use energy
                    to enhance melee attacks, increasing their damage and adding
                    visual effects.

                Parkour in Warframe is an integral part of the game's fast-paced,
                acrobatic movement system, allowing players to traverse
                environments swiftly and fluidly. This system enhances both combat
                and exploration, making mobility a key aspect of gameplay. Here's
                a detailed look at the parkour mechanics in Warframe Bullet Jump:
                A powerful jump that propels the player forward quickly. This move
                is a staple for traversing long distances and evading enemies.
                Double Jump: Allows players to perform a second jump in mid-air,
                providing additional height and distance. Wall Run and Wall Hop:
                Players can run along walls and hop between surfaces, enabling
                vertical and horizontal traversal of the environment. Aim Glide:
                By holding the aim button while in the air, players can slow their
                descent, allowing for precision shooting or extended jumps. Roll
                and Dodge: Players can perform rolls and dodges to quickly evade
                enemy attacks or navigate through tight spaces.
